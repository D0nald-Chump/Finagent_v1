# Financial Statements Data Loader

A tiny library that downloads the latest **10-Q** for a ticker, parses XBRL with **Arelle**, and
reconstructs **BS, IS, CF, SE** directly from the **presentation roles** (includes both `us-gaap:*`
 and company extension tags).

## Quick Start

### Build ENV
```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

### Example usage
```python
from dataloader import get_four_statements

frames = get_four_statements(
    ticker="TSLA",
    user_agent="FinAgents/1.0 (contact: you@example.com)"
)
print(frames["BS"].head())
```

### Notes
- Set a real **User-Agent** (with contact) to follow SEC fairâ€‘use guidance.
- Live integration test is **opt-in**: set `SEC_UA` env var to run it: `SEC_UA="..." pytest -k integration`.
- By default, we filter to consolidated (no segment axes) and USD/pure units.
```
