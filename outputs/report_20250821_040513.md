# Executive summary
- Balance-sheet strength: cash & investments of $36,782m, low consolidated leverage (total debt $7,220m → debt/equity 9.3%; debt/assets 5.6%) and large net cash position (total net cash ≈ $29,562m). On a recourse basis (ex‑non‑recourse project debt $6,953m) recourse net cash ≈ $36,515m and recourse leverage is immaterial.
- Operating picture: Q2‑2025 revenue $22,496m (−12% YoY) with consolidated gross profit $3,878m and Adjusted EBITDA $3,401m (margin 15.1%). GAAP operating income $923m (4.1% margin) and GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders reported at $1,172m; company non‑GAAP net income (ex‑SBC & digital‑asset remeasurement) = $1,393m.
- Liquidity & cash flow: operating cash flow $2,540m; capex $2,394m; free cash flow $146m (Q). Working‑capital build (inventory +864m; prepaids +1,038m) absorbed cash q/q (~$1,489m ΔWC) and was the primary driver of the thin FCF. Digital‑asset fair‑value gain (~$284m pre‑tax; ~$222m after‑tax) created volatility in “Other income” and the CFO reconciliation.
- Near‑term focus: inventory/prepaid discipline and capex prioritization to restore FCF cadence; obtain detailed lease/debt notes to reconcile ROU assets to lease liabilities and to fully segregate recourse vs non‑recourse exposures.

## Risk flags / items to monitor
1. Working‑capital cash drag — ΔWC q/q = +1,489m (inventory +864m; prepaid & other +1,038m) was the primary cash absorber, explaining much of the drop in FCF.
2. Free cash flow fragility — FCF only $146m this quarter; persistent high CapEx or continued WC build would sustain pressure on liquidity despite large cash balances.
3. Digital‑asset volatility — $284m pre‑tax fair‑value gain (~$222m after tax) drove most of "Other income"; this is non‑cash and volatile and materially affects GAAP CFO reconciling items.
4. SBC and R&D ramp — SBC $635m (pre‑tax) and R&D $1,589m materially compress GAAP margins; monitor cadence and capitalization policy.
5. Lease accounting and mapping — sizable ROU assets (Operating lease ROU assets 5,633; Operating lease vehicles, net 5,230). Lease liabilities are embedded across “Accrued liabilities & other” and long‑term other liabilities; detailed lease note needed to reconcile.
6. Non‑recourse debt concentration — $6,953m of non‑recourse debt is large relative to total debt; while largely project‑secured, it requires separate assessment for consolidated credit exposure and recourse metrics.
7. Cash & investments reconciling item (FX/other) — +$412m residual in cash‑movement reconciliation needs breakout (FX on investments, mark‑to‑market, restricted cash movements).
8. Small cross‑statement discrepancy to resolve — GAAP net income appears as $1,172m (net income attributable to common) in IS section, but CF section references Net income $1,190m. Canonicalize consolidated vs attributable line and show NCI reconciling item.
9. Classification/residuals in CFO reconciling lines — “Other non‑cash adjustments” and the residual that bridges ΔBS WC (ΔWC = +1,489) to cash‑flow “changes in operating assets & liabilities = −673” require full footnote breakout for auditability.
10. Elevated investing portfolio activity — large, lumpy purchases/maturities of marketable securities (purchases −7,485m; maturities +6,935m) create noise in short‑term cash balances.

## Global suggestions / recommended next steps (actionable)
1. Resolve consolidated vs attributable net‑income inconsistency
   - Confirm whether $1,190m is consolidated net income (including NCI) and $1,172m is net income attributable to common. Update all bridges (IS → CF → Non‑GAAP → Adjusted EBITDA) to use one canonical line, and disclose the explicit NCI reconciling amount in every table.
2. Provide full cash‑flow footnote breakout
   - Deliver a line‑by‑line breakout for "changes in operating assets & liabilities", "other non‑cash adjustments" and the FX/other reconciling items so ΔBS (ΔCA/ΔCL) fully ties to the CFO movement with clear sign convention (increase in asset = use; increase in liability = source). Flag any items classified across operating/investing/financing (restricted cash, customer financing, lease‑vehicle flows).
3. Standardize digital‑asset reporting and sign/tax conventions
   - In reconciliations always present digital‑asset amounts as: pre‑tax gain/(loss), tax on gain/(loss), after‑tax gain/(loss), and show algebraic effect on non‑GAAP and Adjusted EBITDA with clear +/− signs. This avoids narrative sign confusion and improves comparability.
4. Normalize terminology & rounding convention
   - Adopt consistent labels across BS/IS/CF (e.g., "Cash & investments", "Accounts receivable, net", "Operating lease ROU asset"). Add short legend: units = millions USD; ratios computed on unrounded figures then rounded; clarify pre‑tax vs net‑of‑tax conventions.
5. Reconcile lease ROU assets to liabilities
   - Provide lease note with liability rollforward and maturity schedule. Produce a table splitting operating vs finance lease liabilities and showing current vs long‑term breakout and which BS captions contain operating lease liabilities (Accrued liabilities & other vs Other long‑term liabilities).
6. Reconcile recourse vs consolidated debt
   - Provide explicit reconciliation: Total debt = recourse debt + non‑recourse debt (+ other). Show debt/equity and debt/assets on both consolidated and recourse bases with consistent denominators and note which assets secure non‑recourse debt.
7. Break out FX/investment reconciling item (+$412m)
   - Provide investment schedule (purchases, maturities, proceeds, unrealized gains/losses) and FX translation impacts so the net change in Cash & investments fully ties to investing & CFO/Financing lines.
8. Improve algebraic signposting in disclosures
   - Replace narrative "sign gymnastics" with a simple reconciliation table: Item | pre‑tax | tax | after‑tax | effect on non‑GAAP (add/subtract). This prevents reader confusion (example: GAAP→Non‑GAAP SBC and digital adjustments).
9. Annotate rounding sources for minor mismatches
   - Add footnotes when small additive mismatches occur (rounding vs classification) and maintain consistency in ratio rounding (to one or two decimals).
10. Prioritize disclosure enhancements to aid investors
   - Add a small MD&A table separating realized vs unrealized digital‑asset activity (cash vs non‑cash). Publish an appendix showing lease maturities, non‑recourse debt covenants/recourse limitations, and a one‑line reconciliation of “Other non‑cash adjustments” components (> $50m).
